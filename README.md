"Creating a style guide that is perfectly in sync with the production environment is the Holy Grail."
[Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guide-best-practices/)

"Hibiscus does the job for Magnolia-CMS." Marcel Kessler

## Overview

The surrounding environment of hibiscus consists of the following parts:
hibiscus-core: would contain the magnolia-instance
hibiscus-ui: contains hibiscus

hibiscus-site: creates an overlay of hibiscus-core and hibiscus-ui, which can then be deployed
